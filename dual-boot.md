# Before doing anything

- Install Windows 10.
- Disable Fast Startup in Windows and reboot.
- Shrink space from the main partition (50GB to 200GB depending on your use case for linux).
- Install your linux distribution on the free space.
- **It is recommonded to create a seperate EFI partition (For UEFI users) and installing grub there instead of the Windows EFI partition. This will avoid any problems when installing Windows updates.**
